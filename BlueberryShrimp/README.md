# "Blueberry Shrimp" Projects

This folder contains the example projects from the *Blueberry Shrimp* chapter of the Pi Intermediate Projects book.

The projects combine a **Raspberry Pi** with a **Shrimp**, (a reference implementation of a breadboarded Arduino-compatible circuit), which communicate using a HC-06 Bluetooth serial module as a foundation for a variety of different games and interactive multimedia systems.

Within the book, each sensor configuration is provided with full build instructions for both solderless breadboard and soldered copper stripboard, as well as some simple Arduino code to run on the Shrimp, and Python code to run on the **Pi**. Within this folder are the individual demonstration applications, one per section, containing the tested code for both Pi and Shrimp. 

## Case Studies

Case studies using this system include...

* Picussion - triggering audio samples on the Pi using wearable wireless knock sensors
* Fly Swat - an interactive game of multiple bluetooth wearables where the Pi synthesises a fly, which periodically lands on one of the wearable sensors, (led lights up), and players try to squash it (Pi plays SPLAT! noise) before it takes off again.
* Weather Cube - an interactive cube which associates the playback of different sound samples with the different faces of the cube
* Blueberry One Man Band - a gesture-based interface using wearables to trigger various different instruments based on movement of the limbs.

### Why is it called Blueberry Shrimp

The Shrimp Arduino Compatible layout has been documented through the ShrimpingIt project which began in Morecambe, UK, a town famous for its shrimps. Shrimp projects are often named after members of the biological shrimp family, such as the Copper Shrimp (stripboard layout) or Breaded Shrimp (solderless layout). Combining Bluetooth and Raspberry Pi naturally leads to the phrase Blueberry Shrimp, and indeed there is a real shrimp [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neocaridina-palmata.jpg](Neocaridina Palmata) which carries the common name Blueberry Shrimp.
